# The versioned source keeps __VEYRA_URL__, __VEYRA_TOKEN__, and
# __VEYRA_ALLOW_LIVE__ placeholders; all three are injected from the
# environment at compile time, so no secret or environment hostname is
# committed. VEYRA_EA_URL defaults to the loopback endpoint; set it to the
# tunnel URL (https://veyra.antonlabs.cc/ea/poll) when the terminal reaches
# Veyra through Cloudflare instead of localhost. VEYRA_EA_ALLOW_LIVE defaults
# to true, so the compiled EA is armed and the service switch plus the risk gate
# remain the controls; set it to false to compile an EA that only reports dry runs. The script prints which one it
# compiled.
# Run: `set -a; source .env; set +a; ./scripts/compile_ea.sh`

# to agree before any command reaches the terminal. Arming is an explicit
# choice per run; set VEYRA_EA_ALLOW_LIVE=false to compile a dry-run-only EA.
